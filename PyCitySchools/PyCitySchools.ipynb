    "Based on the analysis and test reports summary created for both (District wide and school wise ), the two key observations on the current trends are: \n",
    "\n",
    "##School Type impact on Performance\n",
    "One noticeable trend is that Charter Schools outperform district schools in terms of overall passing percentage. \n",
    "All top 5 performing schools, with the highest overall passing percentages are charter schools and in contrast, district schools are in bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Budget per Student and Performance:\n",
    "If we analyze scores by schools spending data, another noticeable trend is the relationship between per student budget and student performance.\n",
    "The data indicates that schools with lower per student budgets often outperform schools with higher per student budgets.\n",
    "For instance, “Cabrera High School” has  $582 budget per student and have 91.33 percent overall passing rate."
